# Clinical-Decision-Support-System
The project is done using python and machine learning models in anaconda app

#Description:
Due to big data progress in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate study of medical data benefits early disease recognition, patient care and community services. When the quality of medical data is incomplete the exactness of study is reduced. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique appearances of certain regional diseases, which may results in weakening the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this project, it bid a Machine learning Decision tree map, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) , Perceptron algorithm by using structured and unstructured data from hospital.
